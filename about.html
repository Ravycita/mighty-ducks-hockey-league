        <p>
          The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
          athletes residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment
          in which to learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must
          be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside
          neighborhood. MDHL ran by o small full-time staff, and relies on the
